# Heart Disease Detector

The Heart Disease Detector is a web-based application that predicts the likelihood of heart disease in individuals based on key health metrics. This project demonstrates the integration of machine learning with a web application using **Logistic Regression** for predictions.


## Features

- User-friendly interface for entering health parameters.
- Predicts the probability of heart disease based on input.
- Displays results with clear and concise feedback.


## Tech Used

### Frontend:
- **HTML** for structure.
- **CSS** for styling and responsiveness.
  
### Backend:
- **Flask** for server-side logic.
- **Python** for implementing logistic regression and handling data.


## How It Works

1. **Input Data:** Users enter their health metrics (e.g., age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, etc.).
2. **Model Prediction:** The Logistic Regression model predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on the input.
3. **Result Display:** The result is displayed on the web interface with an appropriate message.
